# Java-Media-Player

This is a Java application that can play both music(mp3) and videos(mp4). It searches music on the basis of songs, videos, artists, albums and genres. You can create your own playlist and listen to music from it as per your choice. Every song and video can be rated. It can keep track of the most played songs and recent plays. It can play any music and video from the computer by selecting it.

You can find all the features that a music player has, topped with an amazing GUI.

To run it on your PC, ensure that you have a MySQL data base installed. Open the project, go to the FXMLDocumentController.java file, and set the directory on line 299.

Enjoy the software.
